# CakePHP fork

This is a fork of version 2 of the CakePHP project with the goal of keeping the framework running on newer versions of PHP. The official 2.x branch is EOL and the framework tests cannot be run on versions of PHPUnit above 5. This fork is therefore necessary to update PHPUnit to newer versions and therefore support PHP 8 (hopefully).

[Original CakePHP 2 documentation](https://book.cakephp.org/2/en/contributing/documentation.html)

# Support
This repository is not intended to be used by developers from outside our team and will eventually be moved to a private repository/package. We will not address PRs or issues from outside our team.

# Changes made to date
- Deleted ControllerTestCase and sub-classes
- Updated PHPUnit to version 6
- Updated PHPUnit to version 7
- Removed ability to run app/plugin tests with Cake's test shell
- Updated the core test suite so that it can be run using PHPUnit's standard test runner and doesn't require Cake's test shell
- Updated PHPUnit to version 8

# Roadmap

- Update PHPUnit to version 9
- Run Rector on test suite to remove calls to static PHPUnit methods (e.g. assertions) using `$this->`
- Execute framework tests on PHP 7.4
- Execute framework tests on PHP 8.0
- (BREAKING) Add all framework classes to composer classmap and remove App::uses()
- (BREAKING) Re-arrange framework code into separate `src`, `test` folders, and remove the `app` template folder from this repository
- Delete parts of the framework that we do not use / are unlikely to ever use (e.g. Postgres DboSource)

#Running tests

Run the tests in a CentOS VM. You will need the following in addition to our basic PHP set-up.

```
sudo yum -y install glibc-locale-source glibc-langpack-en
sudo localedef -v -c -i es_ES -f UTF-8 es_ES
sudo localedef -v -c -i de_DE -f UTF-8 de_DE
```

Running tests:
`vendors/bin/phpunit`

By default, the tests run with an sqlite database, to run for MySQL, you need to configure a database connection in `app/Config/database.php` and make sure the following empty databases have been created:
`cakephp_test`, `cakephp_test2`, `cakephp_test3`, and then set the env var `DB` to `mysql`, i.e.:
`DB=mysql vendors/bin/phpunit`

These numbers are useful to know when upgrading PHPUnit as you can see easily if some tests are being missed or duped!

SQLite:
```
OK, but incomplete, skipped, or risky tests!
Tests: 4028, Assertions: 18830, Skipped: 320.
```

MYSQL:
```
OK, but incomplete, skipped, or risky tests!
Tests: 4028, Assertions: 19551, Skipped: 193.
```


# KAMI Fork of CakePHP 2 with support for PHP8

~~For original README content please check original repository: https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/tree/2.x~~

Unfortunately branch 2.x in original repository was taken down.

## Why I created this fork? ü§î

CakePHP 2 stopped getting updates in the end of 2019 (AFAIR). Unfortunately in my case it's too expensive to migrate to newer versions of CakePHP. I started migrating to Symfony framework, but I still use ORM from CakePHP (and actually I like it). So in order to keep up with the newest PHP versions I decided to create fork of the framework.

## Why you should NOT use? ‚õî

- Intention of this fork is to support PHP 8.*. Fork is not going to receive new features. Instead, fork is going to get minimal set of patches to comply with newer versions of PHP.
- If for example you're still on 5.6 or 7.0, you should **not** use this fork. Original `cakephp/cakephp` works perfectly fine on all PHP 7.* versions. You should migrate to newer versions of PHP and keep using original code. Once your application is battle tested on production I suggest migrating to PHP 8.

## When you could use this fork? ‚úÖ

Only prerequisite is to have your application already on PHP 7.4. Upgrade project to PHP 8.0 and replace CakePHP with this fork.

### Migration

Here are steps I took to migrate my project through all versions to PHP 8.1, maybe it can inspire you:

1. Decouple your tests from `CakeTestCase` and other utilities that are coupled to old PHPUnit version.
2. Once decoupled you can upgrade PHPUnit to the newest version accordingly to your PHP version.
3. Start upgrading gradually to newer versions of PHP. CakePHP 2 works perfectly fine on 7.0 - 7.4.
4. Once you're on 7.4 you can switch to 8 and this fork.

## Before using this fork ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Tests of CakePHP framework aren't refactored yet to support PHP 8. Main issue is old version of PHPUnit that is tightly coupled to framework's tests. Issue for fixing this situation is here: https://github.com/kamilwylegala/cakephp2-php8/issues/7
- Due to lack of tests ‚òùÔ∏è - **you need to rely** on tests in your application after integrating with this fork.
- If after integration you spot any issues related to framework please let me know by creating an issue or pull request with fix.

## Installation

This repository **is not** available in packagist, therefore your project's `composer.json` must be changed to point to custom repository.

Example configuration:
```
{
	"require": {
		"cakephp/cakephp": "dev-master as 2.10.24",
	},
	"repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/kamilwylegala/cakephp2-php8"
        }
    ]
}
```

It means that composer will look at `master` branch of repository configured under `repositories` to resolve update of `cakephp/cakephp` package.

## Changelog

### 2022-03-08

- Fixed passing `params["pass"]` argument to `invokeArgs` when resolving controller action - `array_values` used to avoid problems with named parameters.

### 2022-03-03

- Removed `String` class.

### 2022-03-02

- Fixed `ConsoleErrorHandler::handleError` to respect error suppression.

### 2022-01-31

- Fixed `Folder->read`, `array_values` is used to remove keys to prevent usign named arguments in `call_user_func_array`

### 2022-01-16

- Fix Shell `ReflectionMethod::__construct` default null argument in hasMethod

### 2022-01-15

- Readme file update - more explicit content.

### 2022-01-04

- Fixed more deprecation notices
	- `strtoupper` + `converting false to array` in Mysql.php
	- `preg_match` where `$subject = null` in CakeRoute.php
	- `strtoupper` in DboSource.php
	- Check history for details ‚òùÔ∏è


### 2021-12-20

- Fixed deprecation notices in PHP 8.1 for production code implementations:
	- `ArrayAccess`
	- `Countable`
	- `IteratorAggregate`
- PHP 8.0 requirement in composer.json
- **Warning:** Tests are not updated, Cake's tests rely on old version of PHPUnit so running them may show a lot of deprecations notices. Added issue to cover it: #7

### 2021-02-24

- Fixed ErrorHandler accordingly to PHP8 migration guide. Otherwise, error handler is logging too much and doesn't respect configured `error_reporting`.
